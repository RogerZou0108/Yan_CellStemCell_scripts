# Yan_CellStemCell_scripts


This repository contains scripts to generate the figures listed below for Yan et al. Cell Stem Cell 2018

Mendeley Dataset 13 (http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/rd2sbgm35y.1) - TFvTO
Figure 5C&D - Combat
Figure 5B - TOvTFvFib
Figure 4A and Mendeley Dataset 10 (http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/8v95h5rd6p.1) - SuperFreq

For Mendeley Dataset 13, Figure 5B,C and D. Execution of the R script will reproduce the core part of each of the respective Figure in the paper.

Fore Figure 4A and Mendeley Dataset 10, the SuperFreq directory only contains a template script and instructions to reproduce the figure as BAM and VCF files have to be first download from the EGA repository and scripts generated individually for each sample for execution on a high performance computer.
